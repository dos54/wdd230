            <p>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I
            know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may
            accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</p>
